      <h3>Fuse is enterprise-ready.</h3>
      <p>It starts with the integration framework Camel and then adds a variety of extensions that enterprise developers can use to build in routes and connect JavaEE components. It can use code written in the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and Red Hat Container Development Kit. Fuse can easily provision scalable applications for the largest deployments too.</p>

    <div class="pf-l-grid__item pf-m-12-col pf-m-4-col-on-md pf-m-3-col-on-lg">
      <h3>Fuse comes with powerful integrations that enable you to easily connect to your other SaaS applications.</h3>
      <p>It has a large collection of connectors (what Apache calls Components) to various legacy systems (including Box, Azure, CouchDB, AWS etc.) to make integration and data exchange easier. Many of these integrations are accomplished with a single and simple URI command string. For example, using these URIs, you can exchange data with external websocket and AWS servers, send notifications to Apple iOS devices, download files stored on Box and OneDrive, and integrate with various databases including CouchDB, ElasticSearch and Hadoop).</p>

      <h3>Variety of deployment</h3>
      <p>Fuse is a single platform which can be deployed in three different ways (on-prem up to total cloud).

Fuse collects the numerous open source projects into a single place to make installation simple and to be able to quickly start building apps.</p>
